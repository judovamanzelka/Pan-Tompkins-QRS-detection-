# Pan-Tompkins-QRS-detection-
The Lam-Tompkins QRS detection algorithm is an enhanced version of Pan-Tompkins, improving noise resistance and peak detection through dynamic thresholding, moving window integration, and post-processing techniques. It is widely used for accurate QRS detection in ECG signals, even in noisy environments.
